    "## Background and motivation\n",
    "It's important to anchor anonymization to the NEMA DICOM standard - my early attempts at constructing DICOM file objects failed due to a lack of attention to Type 1 (required) vs Type 2/3 information modules. For anonymizing data for deep learning research, the primary assumption is that patient characteristics are stored externally (such as in a CSV) and mapped via MRN to the DICOM objects. As such, it is not necessary to retain *any* information about the patient in the DICOM files themselves, apart from a new anonymized ID that can serve as the mapper to similarly anonymized information sets in patient characteristics and outcome labels.\n",
    "Therefore, our anonymization functions should walk through the data elements contained in a DICOM file, and if the data element contains data that is relevant to the object itself (such as Rows or Pixel Spacing attributes for images, or actual contour data for structure sets), then that data element should be retained. If the data element is not directly related to the object itself, but rather provides context (such as referring physician, scanner type, etc), then it should be removed. The caveat to such removal is conscientious handling of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 data elements. Type 1 must have a value, so any Type 1 element beyond Patient ID that is slated for removal will need a dummy value inserted. Type 2 must be present but is permitted to be zero-value, so these will be replaced by empty strings. Type 3 elements can be removed completely to no ill effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scope clarity, this module only will anonymize CT, MR, PET, RTSTRUCT, RTDOSE, and RTPLAN. Any other modality passed to the function will be not be output to the destination folder."
